# 2018-04-Sketches
A month of sketches made in Processing

![Month of Processing](/screenshot.png "Month of Processing")

A lot of the information on how to make these things came from Dan Shiffman and his [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) work. 

These are all sketches and are as such...sketchy. They are littered with horrible and inefficient code. I discovered the excellent [PostFX Library](https://github.com/cansik/processing-postfx) to make them all look nice and shiny.

You can see them in action at my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_gomako) I made them in April 2018 so depending on when you read this you may have to scroll a bit.
